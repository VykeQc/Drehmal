> Comms with the **Aphelion** are a bit on the fritz. I’ve been maintaining contact with Grihfs, trying to get him to fix it on their end. The **most important vessel** in the Avsohmic fleet needs to have absolutely zero downtime in its communications. If something were to happen to it, we would need to know immediately. Grihfs thinks it’s an issue with one of the arrays, either receiving too much power or too little. I still need to check the wiring over here.
