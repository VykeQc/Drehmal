> The seat of emperor within Avsohm has been held by three individuals so far. First Drehn, then Ifeihl, and now **Anyr**. Ifeihl experienced numerous military failings during his reign, resulting in the populace’s want for a competent strategist to take the throne. Thus, Grand General Anyr was the obvious choice. In a time of peak scientific progress and power for Avsohm, Emperor Anyr will surely lead us to glorious victory against **Maelihs** in the west.
