> The **Mythbreaker Project** would not have been possible without my finest work, The Graviton Crucible. This construct is what allowed us to forge the blades. Even still, it was only safe enough to forge them. We couldn’t risk a graviton detonation here. Recent scans from the **Aphelion** crew, however, indicate that we may have found a **secondary source** of primal energy that we could use to charge the blades with. Anyr will be very pleased.
