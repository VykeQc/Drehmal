Avast, ye who pick up this dusty tome. You have encountered the personal affect of the great Captain Ihb, the meanest pirate who ever sailed the seas of Drehmal! At least, that's what they said fifteen years ago. Truth is, I'm getting old, and want to settle down. I've written the tales of my many journeys, and frankly, the royalties I've gotten from book sales made me more money than sailing the seas ever did. I really thought I would settle down in this nice town and take up fishing for the rest of my life, but I've never been given the easy way out. You see, I was just offered a job I can't refuse: piloting the newest Avsohmic airship. Apparently, Emperor Anyr was a big fan of my work, and decided that I was the perfect fit for their greatest project. The pay and benefits are great, and I've never been one to turn down adventure. Captain Ihb sets sail once more!
