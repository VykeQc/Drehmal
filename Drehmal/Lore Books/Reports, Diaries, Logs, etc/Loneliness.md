I'm now the resident of this place. It's sickeningly quiet in here, so different from what I lived back in the city.

I still have an altar at least. Although I'm concerned about its size, and what it worships. With a white this pure, it can not be anything harmful.

It is very lonely here, I wonder if this is worth it. This is my purpose after all.

My plant is doing amazing since that doctor tested her products on it. It got most of its leaves back. In a deserted place like this, it's good to have company, even from vegetals.

I am decently sure I heard footsteps roaming around the other night. Maybe it will finally be time to use my trusty sword. I am the lone guardian of this place after all.

The altar is still dazzling. I clean it everyday. It is... mesmerising.
