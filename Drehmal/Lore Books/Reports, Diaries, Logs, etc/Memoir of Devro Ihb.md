Ah, Kazzani. It's a beautiful place. Hard to believe this will be the last time I'll ever visit. As excited as I am by the (personal!) summons from Anyr, I've been told that it's more of a... permanent position. Avsohm doesn't want their secrets getting out, after all. Well, I can't say I'm disappointed.

It's not every day I get to pilot a cutting edge Avsohmic airship.
