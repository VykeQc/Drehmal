We sure do get a lot of tourists in the jolly old City of Tides these days. The usual throngs head to the Kiln, of course, but we’ve also seen plenty of foreigners shopping around the Parish Memorial Plaza and the main downtown streets. Precious few, however, know about the real heart and soul of Firteid commerce- the black market at Calahva Alley. Located right below the Merchant’s Guild, you won’t find better deals this side of the Desolation! I’ll need to bring Boroh and Laga when they finally come to visit.
