Found this old picture in the rubble. Seems to be the only thing left when we arrived. This place has been ransacked by every bandit group since the start of the Third Avihm. Strange that they left this behind... or they didn't find it.

I can organize an expedition to find this strange door, but who knows where it could be. Maybe some of the other Mihkmari clans have seen or heard of it? Could head to Okeke or Dusps to get some information, as I've heard their libraries are somewhat comprehensive.

We have too much on our agenda, though. Can't go on a goose chase for some cool looking door.

We have our own mysterious door here in Av'Sal to worry about.
