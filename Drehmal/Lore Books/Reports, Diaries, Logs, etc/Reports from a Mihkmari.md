Day 4:
We've set up shop in some big ol' Avsohmic building. Mael knows what it was used for, but it keeps out the cold better than anything else here. Tomorrow we plan to send a contingent to secure the central island, see if that grand empire left any goodies for us.
Day 7:
Well, it could've gone better. Didn't find any resistance beyond the rats, but we didn't find anything useful either. There were a bunch of dumb terminals, but none of 'em were working. Only thing still functioning was a damn door that stopped us from getting further in.
