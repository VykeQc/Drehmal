Chapter 1
-------------------
Though many outside the region are unaware, the name "Tharxax" is actually a Maelmari bastardization of "Tharhan", the name of two ancient Drehmari empires which thrived in western Drehmal. 

These volumes tell their story. 

The First Tharhan Empire was one of the most ancient civilizations to arise in Av2. Though very little could be gleaned from the few artifacts found by Avsohmic archaeologists on-site at the First Tharhan capitol of Elthun (modern-day Tharxax City), the Av3 discovery of the Patheraad unveiled the story of a surprisingly advanced society. 

It all began along the river Salah. Early tribes of survivors were drawn to the land as one of the first habitable places created by the Serpent in the west, and they immediately began irrigation and agriculture. Though kings and lords grew to dominate the region, it would not be long until Tharhan was engulfed in the Deity War. 

Legend has it that King Kathis was faced with a fateful decision: either bribe Maelihs by sending riches and peoples to the Burnt Lord in exchange for sending his armies east instead of north, or risk direct attack by the deity and his chaotic forces. Kathis chose the former. In return for civilians, supplies, currency, and resting places, the First Tharhan Empire would be spared. 

And thus, the Empire took on a decidedly Maelific flair. Under the Southern Code, felons and some misdemeanants would be punished by transportation. For felons, this meant a journey to Rhaveloth and conversion to Maelmari. But for the misdemeanants punished this way, it meant being blindfolded and brought north, to the faraway Ebony Veldt. This lesser punishment seemed to accomplish its goal, for none returned, and the prisoners were assumed dead to ravenous beasts. 

And yet, die they did not. Even as centuries went by and the First Tharhan Empire collapsed to internal strife, the prisoners and their descendants remained. Most settled underground in caves most beasts could not reach. The largest  cavern became a town, and then a castle, and then a city. 

This underground sanctuary was known as Caer Adacia. It is from here that the history known as the Patheraad was written.


-------------------

## Chapter 2

From its inception, Caer Adacia was not like its predecessor. Rather than being ruled by kings, the City of Shadow was matrilineal and controlled largely by a powerful line of queens. With a carefully controlled population fed by fungi cultivation, the Drehmari of Caer Adacia had no need to leave the safety of their home. Indeed, fearing retaliation from more powerful neighbors, the queens allowed very few to leave.

And yet, the young are often restless, and thus some is known about what occurred above the ground. When supplemented by other relics from the period, we have a reasonably clear picture. Six feuding Tharhan states emerged from the wreck of the first empire. Dehar thrived in Ebonfire. Salahnar continued occupying the southern lowlands alongside the Mael-worshipping Erxsival. Mighty Nimahj grew powerful in the northern highlands alongside Loraga. And Avakea, kingdom of the canyon oases, thrived as a center of mineral wealth in modern day Anyr'Nogur. 

Though all of these kingdoms had similar ancestors, all evidence shows that they did not get along. Particularly violent conflict occurred between Loraga and Nimahj, and Erxival frequently attacked the other kingdoms which its people deemed heretical. Occasionally, one kingdom would gain pre-eminence, but when this occurred, temporary alliances assured that its period of dominance was short. 

It is said that nature abhors a vacuum, and so leaderless Tharhan was a tempting target for the mighty Casain Empire far to the northwest. In order to entrench his domestic power, Zarha III sent a very powerful army south across the Ebony Veldt. It was at the narrows between Lake Nimahj and the highlands where it was met by a large but poorly-coordinated Tharhan coalition army with soldiers from all six kingdoms. Though the Tharhan force sustained much heavier losses over the next couple of months, the unified army slowly made progress, pushing the Casain back across the plains.

But the war was not over, as suddenly smoke filled the air to the southwest! Another contingent of Casain forces appeared suddenly, riding gigantic birds from the clifftops of Anyr'Nogur. In one day, the kingdom of Avakea was razed, and the main army's supply lines were cut. Confusion and carnage ruled the day.

----------------------------
## Chapter 3

Then, just as it seemed that Casai had won, a surprise attack took center stage for the second time in as many days. The daughters of the forgotten rose from the earth; Caer Adacia had come to rescue the countrymen who had once condemned them!

Though very bloody, the remaining conflict was swift. Cutting through rebellious Tharhan prince and Casain general alike, the Queen of the Night and her disciplined followers took advantage of the confusion to gain control of the entire plains in under a month.

Then, sitting beneath a double eclipse upon a ceremonial throne atop the Erxsival Arch, Tiderra I was crowned Empress of the Second Tharhan Empire. That night, the capitol was moved to Caer Adacia, the six kingdoms were officially annexed, and the Treaty of One Moon was signed with Casai, ensuring that the desert people could keep the land of Anyr'Nogur in exchange for peace between the two empires and favorable trade policies.

For nearly two centuries, the Second Tharhan Empire was the greatest state in all of Drehmal. By offering ambitious nobles from the lines of former kingdoms positions in her council and creating a modernized code of laws, including a powerful judiciary and bill of rights, Tiderra I brought peace to the West. 

In the reign of Tiderra II, peace was even extended between Tharhan and West Merijool. This alliance irked Casai, but proved to be an effective means of controlling the neighbors. For the first time, Caer Adacia even felt safe enough to spill onto the surface to meet the Torahn's rays. Though Empresses Canirah I and Tiderra III were also relatively effective monarchs, the good days for Tharhan weren't to last forever. Far away in the East, an heir to the Chosen Kingdom who had renounced his birthright but nonetheless found himself in command of a new state would make two discoveries that would change the world. 

The lost rehntite cave of Akhlo'Rohma and the anomalous Mt. 
Yavhlix were catalysts that allowed Avsohmic technology to develop at a dizzying pace. It was well into the reign of Tiderra III when her loyal Nightwalkers were first confronted by Drehn Mal'Sohm's forces, but it was clear that Tharhan had no hope of resistance. Very few arcanists, no matter how trained, could hope to win against a squadron of soldiers armed with energy rifles.

## Chapter 4

Therefore, it was largely through a series of surrenders and alliances that Avsohm subdued the West. Caer Adacia was retained as a regional locus of command, but never again would an Empress hold absolute authority over the plains. 

Life under Avsohmic rule brought many changes for the Tharhan Drehmari. The former provinces of Erxsival and Salahnar were ironically reunited with the long-lost Tharhan lands of Anyr'Nogur under the rule of House Anyr at Sal'Anyr (formerly the Casain metropolis of Azen'nath). Meanwhile, Loraga was subsumed into Nimahj, where House Silar ruled Nimahj Citadel. Finally, Dehar and the Veldt were ruled by House Vera at Caer Adacia. 

The story of Avsohm in its entirety is one for another volume, but for the Tharhanese, Avsohmic rule usually meant a life of hard labor in the river valleys. In exchange for producing much of the food for the Empire, however, the people did achieve a very high standard of living, with new benchmarks for sanitation, health care, technology, and personal mobility set every year. 

As we all know, though none predicted at the time, Avsohm never survived its third ruler. With no warning and in barely a day, the entire ruling structure of Avsohm disappeared. Along with massive loss of life came a mass upheaval of social order and rejection of any Avsohmic  technology or paraphernalia. Taking advantage of the chaos, Maelihs quickly seized his opportunity. Soon, in what became known as the Dune Wars, the Burnt Lord massacred the Drehmari of the West all the way to the wall of Maehrn'Vhos. Even Caer Adacia was powerless to stop it.   

Since Mael's takeover, only Fort Nimahj has continued to stand as a bulwark for Drehmari in the cruel Tharxax Plains. That condition is one that the Insohmic Coalition seeks to remedy. With Merijool and Casai now voting members of the Grand Council, the time is ripe for a Tharhan resurgence. It is this historian's hope that this account will help the Drehmari who come to settle in a new Tharhan to begin rekindling the embers of a great Western society. There have been many successes for the people of the plains, and just as many failures. But whether a new Drehmari ruler comes to sit at Caer Adacia or Tharxax City, it would be wise for them to heed the voices of the past.
