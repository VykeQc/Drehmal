Sacred fire, burning bright,

Turn the darkness into light! 

May the ordered flame thus burn,

As blue as Ocean's ceaseless churn! 

And when we fade into the sky,

May She stand forever by! 

With sacred fire, burning bright,

May She lead us all from blight.

Bring us Peace.

Bring us Purity.

Bring us Perfection. 

Virtu'alor'agormahl!
