## Part One: The Arc of Twilight

As creatures blessed with memory, we can see the cycles in nature that the others cannot.

When a rock gibbon or a horse sees water in a spring flow off the falls, into a river, and out to sea, there is no indication that it will return. And yet, when we see the rain, our memories tell us that very water is returning to its lofty perch. 

Similarly, when the moons rise and blaze across the horizon, only to set once again, what bee or butterfly of the woods could predict that they will ever rise again? And yet, when the first rays of dawn break the chill of the night, we know that the Torahn will run its course once more. 

Moreover, when the great philosophers, magicians, and sages finally breathe their last breath, perhaps their faithful dogs will whine and hang their heads. But we know that their wisdom will once again be reborn in the clear eyes of the infant. 

Indeed, our power of memory is great. But it is not all-powerful. While we can intuit the workings of these cycles, we are not permitted to view the transmutations which change the setting Torahn to the rising, or the waters of the ocean to the rain, or the old soul to the new. 

Thus, for every arc of the natural cycle we can see modifying the world, there must be a hidden arc of twilight which returns it to its starting point.

## Part Two: The Lesson of Seha River

While one Drehmari with a rowboat can navigate the placid Ohgai River, the roiling Seha requires a crew of at least four to portage the rafts up its steep waterfalls.

There is no such limitation for Vibrant Salmon. Despite their great size, they swim up the Seha every year with the power of weak divine magic to lay their eggs in the highlands. 

Until the roads and cliffside town were built, imitating the salmon was one of the most dangerous tasks done in all of Sahd. And yet, as part of the annual rituals for the Harvest Spirits, it was, and still is one of the greatest honors for young, strong, Sahdans to be selected to undergo. 

And so it was that four were chosen to sail through the Hidden Vale from the mouth of the Seha up to the highlands. One was a young warrior, seeking to inflict pain and receive it for her country. Another was a young politician, seeking the pleasures of fame while bringing the pleasures of honor to his homeland. 
A third was a young monk, seeking to relieve themselves from fear through devotion while bringing the fear of divine wrath to their congregation. Finally, the fourth was a young woodcarver. He only sought survival and to accumulate wisdom which would aid his family's practice. 

As they began on their journey, the four were in high spirits. Suddenly, however, the monk's voice cried out in alarm, and a terrible scraping sound echoed on the steep walls of the gorge. A jagged rock had burst through the raft! Following the politician's lead and using the warrior's strength, they managed to wade through the strong current and bring the raft to a stony bank. Then, breathing heavily, they sat down to plan their next move. 

The warrior spoke first: "This hole is inconsequential. Though it might be painful and difficult to continue, we should still proceed." Agreeing to try, the four placed the raft back in the river and tried to paddle with all their might, but were swiftly rejected by the strong current and hole in the hull. 

Next, the politician spoke: "The other townsfolk will not know what transpired. We should abandon the boat here and simply walk back, telling them we reached the top. After all, it is a lovely day, and it would be much more pleasurable to quit now than to continue and fail again". But after attempting to scale the tall gorge wall, it became clear that they were trapped. 

Third, the monk's voice rose, quaveringly. "I am fearful of what will happen to us if we try to continue forwards, climb that steep wall, or scale back down along the rocks. We should hope that they fear for us and wait for rescue". 

And so, they began to wait. The warrior became impatient and began to cruelly mock the monk. The monk sat, head in hands, in the throes of panic. And the politician lazily perched on a rock, practicing his campaign speeches. 

Finally, the woodcarver spoke. "I have finished a patch for the raft. I'm not sure that it will hold, but the four of us set out with one goal in mind. Though I am not as accomplished, I think that the only way we can reach the top of the river is if we work together and use each of our strengths." 

And so they set out again. The warrior used their great strength to row against the current. The politician told amusing stories to keep spirits high. The monk kept a careful eye on the surrounding rocks to look for trouble. And the woodcarver did his best to learn all he could along the journey while offering encouragement and keeping the others focused on their task. 

It was thus only with the woodcarver's words that the four young Drehmari were able to traverse the Seha. If nothing else, this tale certainly illustrates the might of the Vibrant Salmon!

## Part Three: Eternal Enlightenment

As we have seen, us Drehmari are blessed with a keen power of memory. But we are also blessed with other powers in common with the other creatures: pain, pleasure, and fear. 

These three powers were granted by the Three: Maen, Moen, and Tethlaen and each can be channeled for good or for evil.

Pain is a powerful motivator. While it can be used for evil to wage war or extract information from a prisoner, it can also be sought in order to strengthen one's body and makes the accomplishment of a goal all the sweeter.

Pleasure, too, is a powerful motivator. While it can be used for evil by way of overindulgence, greed, or carnal acts and can distract from solemn duties, it can also bring happiness through laughter, excitement, friendship, and joint parenthood. 

Fear is a third powerful motivator. It can be used for evil when one succumbs  to ennui or chooses to inflict it unwanted upon others through barbarism or xenophobia. However, it also does good by warning those in danger and saving life and limb.

With our powerful memories, we can see the strengths and drawbacks of each powerful motivator. By harnessing them through thoughtful action and compromise, we can accomplish great things and accumulate what is known as wisdom.

Perhaps the wisest individual in all of Sahd is Mari, the Laughing Dragon himself. By seeing all there was to see of the pain, pleasure, and fear of Drehmari in his travels throughout the realm, he managed to find such wisdom that he has managed to live entirely within the daytime of the world after glimpsing the arc of twilight. 

It is our duty to follow his example and find a way to become truly eternal. By achieving great wisdom, we can follow Mari's lead and forever continue our journey of discovery. Only then will we truly begin to make progress along the Path of Enlightenment. One day, we too shall glimpse the arc of twilight and know all there is to know. 

This is why those of the Path emblazon ourselves with the insignia of a midair Vibrant Salmon. While the cycle will likely recycle most of our souls to be born anew, we seek, in this life or next, to forever move against the current until we can become like the Laughing Dragon.

It is important to reiterate: to be taken for rebirth by the arc of twilight is not a failing. For those who have accumulated wisdom, that wisdom must remain in the soul of the newborn. By drawing upon it, it will be all the easier for them to stride confidently down the Path. 

Rather than being controlled by our pain, pleasure, and fear, we shall control ourselves with our uniquely keen memories. And perhaps, someday, we or our descendants shall reach the summit of the Seha highlands and see what lies beyond.
