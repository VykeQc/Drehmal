I do not know if the two corelate or not, but I find it suspicious that Tethlean, Aspect of Fear is missing (believed dead) and that something called the "Ever-Fear" isn't cooperating anymore causing the whole emergency. The Stasis emergency Protocol's purpose was as a failsafe in case that something bad happen in "that" facility. 

My theory is that the "Ever-Fear" stopped cooperating causing the energy network collapse, then the seal was put in place, but maybe it didn't hold? Then, we went through the stasis protocol and now we're here after who knows how much time.

It does appear like the "Ever-Fear" is the thing that caused the whole problem. "that" facility seems to be the "Primary Energy Collection", Which from another Holotext, I assume is Mt. Yavhlix. And for an ever better surprise, I've been mentioned as C.O.O Orix, probably meaning "Chief Observation Officer". It seems like I was the one in charge of observing this "Ever-Fear"... 

*interesting...

Well... Let's say I got a **LOT** of answers... 

"The Ever-Fear is known by many names. Lord of the Void. Bane of Joy. Betrayer of the Realm. The Harbinger. It is unclear what minor flower of the Primal Tree or loins of an Aspect that he sprung from, but it is said that his original name was Tethlaen."

The Ever-Fear was indeed Tethlaen, Aspect of Fear! My intuitions was right.

But what's weird is that from another book I read. It is said that before he initially "disappeared", Mt. Yavhlix didn't exist? But, after he "walked off the edge of the Realm", Mt. Yavhlix suddenly appeared of the old maps!

Coincidently, The "Ever-Fear" we were talking about in the beginning is what caused the whole emergency in Mt. Yavhlix's Primal Energy Facility. So he was definitely in there somehow.

This Tethlaen is certainly one hell of a guy.
