I do not know if the two corelate or not, but I find it suspicious that Tethlean, Aspect of Fear is missing (believed dead) and that something called the "Ever-Fear" isn't cooperating anymore causing the whole emergency. The Stasis emergency Protocol's purpose was as a failsafe in case that something bad happen in "that" facility. 

My theory is that the "Ever-Fear" stopped cooperating causing the energy network collapse, then the seal was put in place, but maybe it didn't hold? Then, we went through the stasis protocol and now we're here after who knows how much time.


UPDATE:

It does appear like the "Ever-Fear" is the thing that caused the whole problem. "that" facility seems to be the "Primary Energy Collection", Which from another Holotext, I assume is Mt. Yavhlix. And for an ever better surprise, I've been mentioned as C.O.O Orix, probably meaning "Chief Observation Officer". It seems like I was the one in charge of observing this "Ever-Fear"...
