We found, deep under the ruined capital, the hilt of a supposedly very powerful weapon. It is said to be the **absolute pinnacle of Avsohmic weapons technology**. It can apparently be **"charged"** if exposed to a significant quantity of **Primal Energy**. 

I assume that they haven't succeeded because the **Power Grid** didn't have enough energy to power it to it's full potential. A **secondary and more powerful energy source** is probably gonna be required. 

Anyways, the blades have been kept separate in **"secure R&D locations"**, so we'll have to find them before doing anything else.
