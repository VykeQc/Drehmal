Now this is pretty impressing. avSYS seems like a really advanced computational system created by the Avsohmic Empire. Gohri, being the programmer she is, probably worked on it.

avSYS seems to be connected to every piece of technology in Drehmal and a network was made for it to work. We have to **manually recover the network** by activating towers all around Drehmal.
Restoring the network will also bring some other facilities back online and uncorrupt these facilities' Holotext.

avSYS seems to still have an active link with the Terminus, but, like mentioned earlier, lost its link to ancillary facilities.
